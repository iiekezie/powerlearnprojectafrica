# ðŸ“Š Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib

This project is a solution to a Power Learn Project Africa assignment that involves loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Description

Create a Python script or Jupyter Notebook that:

1. Loads and explores a dataset in CSV format (Iris dataset used here).
2. Displays `.head()` output and checks data types.
3. Finds and handles missing values by filling or dropping them.
4. Generates basic statistics using `.describe()`.
5. Groups data on a categorical column and computes the mean of a numerical column per group.
6. Includes at least one interesting pattern or finding in comments.
7. Creates four visualizations:
   - Line chart (trend over time or index)
   - Bar chart (comparison across categories)
   - Histogram (distribution of a numerical column)
   - Scatter plot (relationship between two numerical columns)
8. Customizes each plot with a title, axis labels, and legends where needed.
9. Includes exception handling for file loading and data issues.
10. Uses brief, student-style comments for clarity.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

**Option 1 â€“ Python Script**  
```bash
python analyzing_data_pandas_matplotlib.py
````

**Option 2 â€“ Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook analyzing_data_pandas_matplotlib.ipynb
```

Ensure you have the required packages installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## ðŸ“‚ Files

* `analyzing_data_pandas_matplotlib.py` â€“ Python script with all logic
* `analyzing_data_pandas_matplotlib.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook version
* *(Optional)* Dataset â€“ Loaded directly from an online source (no local CSV needed)

---

## âœ… Output

When the script or notebook runs successfully:

* Dataset is loaded and previewed.
* Missing values are handled (if any).
* Summary statistics and grouped analysis are displayed.
* Four customized charts are generated:

  1. Line chart
  2. Bar chart
  3. Histogram
  4. Scatter plot
* A success message is printed after analysis is complete.
