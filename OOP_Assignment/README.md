# 📂 Power Learn Project Africa – OOP Assignment

This repository contains Python solutions for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** assignment under the **Power Learn Project Africa** program. The assignment focuses on core OOP concepts including class design, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 📝 Assignment Tasks

### ✅ 1. Design Your Own Class
Implemented a `Smartphone` class that:
- Inherits from a base `Device` class
- Includes attributes like brand, model, OS, and storage
- Features methods for installing/uninstalling apps
- Demonstrates encapsulation and inheritance

### ✅ 2. Polymorphism Challenge
Created an animal movement system that:
- Defines a base `Animal` class with abstract `move()` method
- Implements different movement behaviors in subclasses:
  - `Dog` runs 🐕
  - `Fish` swims 🐟
  - `Bird` flies 🦅
  - `Snake` slithers 🐍
- Shows polymorphic behavior through a common interface

---

## 💻 How to Run

```bash
python oop_assignment.py
```

## 🌟 Example Output

```
Smartphone Details:
Apple iPhone 15 (Battery)
OS: iOS
Storage: 128GB
Battery: 4000mAh
Installed Apps: WhatsApp, Instagram

Buddy the dog is running 🐕
Nemo the fish is swimming 🐟
Sky the bird is flying 🦅
Viper the snake is slithering 🐍
```


The program will automatically demonstrate both activities:

1. Smartphone class functionality
2. Polymorphic animal movements

## 📚 Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept          | Implementation Example              |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Inheritance      | `Smartphone` extends `Device`      |
| Polymorphism     | Different `move()` implementations |
| Encapsulation    | Private attributes with methods    |
| Abstraction      | Base `Animal` class                |
| Method Overriding| Custom `__str__` implementations   |
