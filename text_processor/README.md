# ðŸ”¹ Text File Processing Challenge

This project is a solution to a Power Learn Project Africa assignment that involves reading, processing, and writing text files using Python.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Description

Create a Python script that:

1. Creates a file called `input.txt` with at least five lines of text.
2. Reads the contents of `input.txt`.
3. Counts the number of words in the file.
4. Converts all text to uppercase.
5. Writes the processed text and the word count to a new file called `output.txt`.
6. Prints a success message once the new file is created.

---

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

```bash
python text_processor.py
````

Ensure that `text_processor.py` is in the same directory where you want to generate `input.txt` and `output.txt`.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

* `text_processor.py` â€“ Python script with all logic
* `input.txt` â€“ Text file generated with sample content
* `output.txt` â€“ Output file with uppercase text and word count

---

## âœ… Output

When the script runs successfully:

* `input.txt` is created and filled with sample text.
* `output.txt` is created with processed content in uppercase and total word count.
* A success message is printed in the terminal.
